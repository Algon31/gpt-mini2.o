Got it! Here's a full `README.md` file that clearly explains **how to use the repository**, step-by-step — from placing your book, converting it, training the model, and what each part of the repo does. This version is focused on usage instructions:

# 🧠 MiniGPT - Fine-tune GPT-2 on Your Own Book

This repository allows you to fine-tune a GPT-2 model on any book (in PDF format), turning it into a custom language model trained specifically on that content.

---

## 📦 Features

- Convert a PDF book to text
- Tokenize and prepare the dataset
- Fine-tune GPT-2 using HuggingFace Transformers
- Automatically saves and loads training checkpoints
- Easily customizable

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Algon31/Gpt-mini.git
cd Gpt-mini
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📝 How to Use

### Step 1: Add Your Book

Place your `.pdf` file inside the `book/` folder.

Example:

```
book/my_book.pdf
```

---

### Step 2: Convert PDF to Text

Run the following to extract the book text:

```bash
python pdf_txt.py
```

This saves a raw `.txt` file inside the `tokenizing/` folder.

---

### Step 3: Tokenize the Text

Tokenize the extracted text using:

```bash
python tokenizer.py
```

This creates a `tokens.json` file inside `tokenizing/`.

---

### Step 4: Train the Model

Now fine-tune GPT-2 on your tokenized book data:

```bash
python train.py
```

Checkpoints and final model will be saved in the `models/` folder.

---

## ❗ GitHub Push Warning

Some large model files (`.bin`, `.pt`, `.safetensors`) are **not tracked** by Git. To avoid pushing huge files:

`.gitignore` includes:

```
models/
*.pt
*.bin
tokenizing/tokens.json
data/train_clean.txt
```

If you need to push large models, consider using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## ✅ Coming Soon

* `generate.py`: Script to generate text using your trained model
* Streamlined web UI for interaction
